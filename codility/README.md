A collection of solutions of coding quizzes found on https://app.codility.com/programmers/.

Solutions are optimised and achieve 100% score on codility, unless otherwise noted inside the file comments.

Solutions are in C++. Files .cpp are ready to be compiled. In case solutions are cut and pasted into codility and run over there, do not copy the main() functions in the files, that are there just to drive tests.
